---------------Designing of UI-----------------

Divide the problems into tasks 
first ignore the upper part of the calculator and focus on the grid part 
the grid part shows the table with some rows and columns (standard is 4 cols and 5 rows)

We will be building it row by row 

so create a table element in html 

<tr> represnets the table row 
<td> represents the table column in html

We are creating 4 columns in a single row


After creating the rows and columns we add the heigh , widht and alignment to make our calcualtor more good
Then we added the result screen by using an attribute called colspan which span in all four columns 
After this we assign each element an id , so that we can access each element indivually and perform some actions on the values of those
elements

The difference between innerhtml , innertext and textContent is 

eval() will evalute a string expression based on the expressions it will evaluate 9+9 directly we will place this in the equals to button



---------------------------------------Improvements--------------------------------------

Validation of mulitple operators 
evaluate on the button keydown of equal 
try to move the zero on the right instead of left
